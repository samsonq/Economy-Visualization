		<h2>National Unemployment</h2>
		<p>In 2019, unemployment rates were fairly steady and uniform across the country. Once the pandemic hit and spread in April 2020, unemployment increased dramatically, tripling and quadrupling across the states. This impact is larger in areas of higher population and business activity including the western area of California and the northern area of New York.</p>

	<h2>GDP (Gross Domestic Product)</h2>
	<p>The US GDP was on the constant rise from 2018-2019 and peaked at the advent of the coronavirus. Once the pandemic spread and impacted various industries, GDP took a sharp drop around April 2020 where it hit its lowest point. However, the economy is slowly rising again and has regained 2/3 of its original value.</p>

	<h2>Foreign Exchange Rates to USD</h2>
	<p>Because of the increase in unemployment, the United States government has took actions to protect American business by increasing tarrifs and promoting domestic business. These actions have strengthened the value of the US dollar and increased its value in comparison to other international currencies. Because of this appreciation, the ForEx rate of other to currencies to USD has gradually decreased.</p>
